This assignment aims to ensure that students understand a large variety of Australian International Trade datasets and data types. Students will learn data statistical and analytical patterns and use different visualisation techniques to present these patterns and uncover data stories inside the dataset.


The Australian International Trade dataset extracted from ABS Statistics data contains over 30 years of data between 1988 and 2022. The dataset has import and export information, including 10 main categories and 67 sub-categories. Each sub-category involves multiple industries' performances on productivities and resources.
